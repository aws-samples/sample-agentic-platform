# 🚀 Module 3: Building Framework-Agnostic Agent Abstractions

Welcome to Module 3 of the A2B Workshop series! In this module, you'll learn how to build robust, framework-agnostic abstractions for autonomous agents. While we'll use LangGraph for some examples, the focus is on understanding and implementing the core patterns that make agents work, regardless of the framework you choose.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

In this hands-on workshop, you'll:

- 🏗️ Build framework-agnostic abstractions for agent components
- 🧠 Implement core agent patterns (memory, tools, retrieval) from first principles
- 🔄 Create flexible orchestration systems that work across frameworks
- 📊 Design clean interfaces for agent interactions and state management
- 🔍 Compare and contrast different agent frameworks and their tradeoffs

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, you'll need:

- An AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock
- Python 3.12 (this workshop was tested with Python 3.12)
- Basic understanding of LLM applications
- Completion of Modules 1 and 2 is recommended

## 🏁 Getting Started

[Setup instructions remain the same...]

## 📚 Workshop Notebooks

The workshop consists of several notebooks that build foundational abstractions:

### 1. Setup and Environment (`1_setup.ipynb`)
- 🔧 Setting up the development environment
- 💾 Configuring vector stores and LLM clients
- 🚀 Preparing test data for agent interactions

### 2. Agent Memory Systems (`2_agent_memory.ipynb`)
- 💾 Building abstract memory interfaces
- 🧠 Implementing different memory strategies
- 📈 Creating pluggable memory backends

### 3. Agent Tools & Actions (`3_agent_tools.ipynb`)
- 🛠️ Designing flexible tool interfaces
- 🔌 Creating pluggable tool registries
- 🎯 Implementing tool validation and safety checks

### 4. Agent Retrieval Systems (`4_agent_retrieval.ipynb`)
- 🔍 Building abstract retrieval interfaces
- 📚 Implementing different retrieval strategies
- 🔄 Creating composable retrieval pipelines

### 5. Framework Comparisons (WIP) (`6_agent_frameworks.ipynb`)
- 📊 Analyzing different agent frameworks
- 🔍 Understanding framework tradeoffs
- 🔄 Migrating agents between frameworks

### 6. Data Processing & Analysis (`6.1_data_processing_analysis_using_code_interpreter.ipynb`)
- 📊 Using AWS Bedrock AgentCore Code Interpreter for data analysis
- 🔧 Setting up both boto3 and AgentCore SDK approaches
- 📈 Performing statistical calculations on datasets
- 🔄 Processing data with JavaScript and Python

### 7. File Operations (`6.2_file_operations_using_code_interpreter.ipynb`)
- 📁 Comprehensive file operations using Code Interpreter
- 📄 Reading, writing, and processing files
- 📊 Working with JSON and CSV files
- 🔄 Complete file workflows including upload, process, and verify


## 🧭 Workshop Flow

1. Start with the setup notebook to configure your environment
2. Follow the notebooks in order, building each abstraction layer
3. Each notebook focuses on a core agent component with framework-agnostic implementations
4. Later notebooks show how these abstractions can work with different frameworks
5. Complete the exercises to reinforce understanding of the patterns

Each notebook includes:
- Detailed explanations of core patterns and abstractions
- Clean interface definitions
- Reference implementations
- Framework integration examples
- Practice exercises to reinforce concepts

## 🎯 Key Learning Goals

- Understanding core agent patterns independent of frameworks
- Building clean, reusable abstractions for agent components
- Learning to evaluate and choose appropriate frameworks
- Implementing flexible, maintainable agent systems
- Creating framework-agnostic agent architectures

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check your AWS credentials and permissions
2. Verify Bedrock model access (especially for Claude models)
3. Ensure all required packages are installed via `uv sync`
4. Review error messages carefully

Start with `1_setup.ipynb` and proceed through each notebook in sequence. Focus on understanding the abstractions and patterns before diving into specific framework implementations.

Happy learning! 🎉
